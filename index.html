        <h2>How we got started</h2>
        <p>We were founded in 2019 by a group of friends who wanted to create a place where people could come together and share their love of pets, food, and travel. Our founders loved taking their pets on trips around the world and soon realized other pet enthusiast did to. As they traveled through Italy with their dog bud, they bumped into a couple traveling from Arizona with their dog, Sam. As they all walked their dogs down the streets of Italy while enjoying Gelato, the idea of an online community for pet, travel, and food lovers was birthed.</p>
